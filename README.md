To date, I have experience with following tools/languages:

| Golang          | This is my first and most favourite programming language. I love it because it has overly strict typing (which prevents a lot of misunderstanding) and C-like syntax, which, by itself, is quite intuitive (at least for me) and easy-to-read. That, by the way, is especially the case with Golang, since it has one specific style which is enforced by built-in tool gofmt and linters which means in a lot of places you would see code with familiar formatting and that boosts readability quite well | Very advanced; I am familiar with a lot of nuances of the language, can write complex programs without assistance from linters/hints | January 2019 |
