# Hi, I'm Ignatijs Krasovskisüëã

## üç™ To date, I have experience with following tools/languages

<div><img src="headings/go.svg" style="height: 150px" alt="can't-load-svg" /></div>

<p align="justify">This is my first and most favourite programming language - when I started programming, I learned basics using Golang as main language. The choice of language was not on me - but on Progmeistars - programming school which I was attending. And I think the choice is a good one. Using golang when I started programming had some positive sides to it:

- Oppresive typing prevented a lot of frustrating mistakes in the early days of programming;
- Made me familiar with C-like syntax, which, in return, makes it easier to learn new programming languages with similar syntax;

And personally, I love it - it has overly strict typing (which prevents a lot of misunderstanding and silly mistakes) and C-like syntax, which, by itself, is quite intuitive and easy-to-read. I can definitely say that I am very advanced in Golang. I am familiar with a lot of nuances of the language, can write complex programs without assistance from linters/hints and also have used it's builtin benchmarking and unit-testing features.</p>

<div><img src="headings/cpp.svg" style="height: 150px" alt="can't-load-svg" /></div>

<p align="justify">I'd say I'm pretty mid in C++. I have been using it for quite some time, so I'm fairly familiar with it's syntax and some of the basic stepping stones, but since I hadn't used it in a while, it may take some time to refresh it in my mind. For some time, I've been using Qt framework for C++ to develop a tiny desktop application, so I am quite familiar with how it's done (using aforementioned languages) and also strenghtened my C++ knowledge and familiarity in the process. Currently, I am planning to use C++ more, to become more or less advance with the language, to obtain in my arsenal a popular and versatile programming language.</p>

<div><img src="headings/vscode.svg" style="height: 150px" alt="can't-load-svg" /></div>

<p align="justify">I can say I am an experienced user of VSCode. I have been using not only the editor, but also have spent some time configuring VSCode specific files which are placed in `.vscode` folder. Also, in the period of writing programs in C++ I have been using those "features" quite extensively which left a solid ground for remembering how to use it proficiently in case I abandon programming for some time. VSCode is the only IDE I can work with, but personally it is not of concern to me, since it is remarkably flexible, has a nice look and is one of the most widely used IDEs, which means it is actively supported and improved.</p>

<div><img src="headings/python.svg" style="height: 150px" alt="can't-load-svg" /></div>

<p align="justify">Out of all languages, python is probably second best known to me. It's syntax is plain and simple, I am familiar with some of it's unique features/oddities and somewhat familiar with it's library. Python is overall easy to learn and use language, but it has one major disatvantage which sometimes makes me consider using other languages, if I have a choice - complete lack of typing. It is obvious that lack of typing will bring up a lot of runtime errors that should be prevented, but those preventions lenghten code and decrease readability. Also, it sometimes is hardly readable due to it's lack of braces or any other reasonable delimitation of scopes of visibility.</p>

<div><img src="headings/sql.svg" style="height: 150px" alt="can't-load-svg" /></div>

<p align="justify">I have a very basic knowledge of SQL, since I have spent around month learning/using it and then stopped. Nevertheless, I have at least a general idea about what it is and some (little) experience in using it through MySQL API for golang. Nevertheless, I have quite little knowledge of databases, types of them and other related stuff, so in that sense I would need a lot of studying to get sense of it.</p>

<div><img src="headings/git.svg" style="height: 150px" alt="can't-load-svg" /></div>

<p align="justify">I'm fairly familiar with git - I've been using it relatively often since the named date and now I feel pretty comfortable with it. While learning it, my dad had been helping me a lot with it, I am very thankful for that. Though, I need a lot more experience using it to be able to use it freely. As for now, I have no experience using git cooperatively or in corporate environment, so I will learn a lot of new stuff when I get to.</p>

<div><img src="headings/cmake.svg" style="height: 150px" alt="can't-load-svg" /></div>

<p align="justify">When I have been creating desktop program with help of Qt framework, I used CMake to correctly and effortlessly compile the source code. Thanks to that - I'm quite familiar with it, although, not a very proficient user. Also, since I hadn't used it in a while, I will need some time to get a grip of it and to start using it again. Originally, I was introduced to CMake when dad recommended that I use it, instead of QMake (an alternative for Qt framework). Even though I used it mainly in context of compiling programs using Qt, I still obtained plenty general knowledge about it.</p>

<div><img src="headings/linux.svg" style="height: 150px" alt="can't-load-svg" /></div>

<p align="justify">Since my dad is a programmer as well, I had Linux installed on my PC for as long as I can remember having PC. And even though I have been using Linux (Ubuntu, specifically) since my early childhood days, I've been using it more as a general user, not making a big use of it's command-line tools, apart from irregularly occuring need to either fix something or some other cases. As of now, I'm at a beginner level and plan to advance at work in learning deeply Linux-based operating systems.</p>

<div><img src="headings/qt.svg" style="height: 150px" alt="can't-load-svg" /></div>

<p align="justify">For such a framework, I've worked too little and in a narrow spectrum of it's abilities to say that I know it well, but what I can say - is that I'm a bit familiar with it's graphical interface development module. Qt is an enormous framework which is used to create desktop programs, I personally used it once to create a program with moving colliding squares, for fun, so I have just a tiny bit of experience with it.</p>

<div><img src="headings/html.svg" style="height: 150px" alt="can't-load-svg" /></div>

<p align="justify">HTML is the very first programming-related concept I learned, but since I'm not really keen on front-end development, I quickly abandoned learning HTML in favor of learning programming languages. Even though I know HTML for a long time, I barely use it, so my skills currently are at a beginner-to-intermediate level.</p>

<div><img src="headings/css.svg" style="height: 150px" alt="can't-load-svg" /></div>

<p align="justify">I know some basic aspects of CSS, but since I hadn't been using it for a long time, not really wanting to do front-end development, I remember only basics about it. I started learning CSS after some introduction to HTML basics, but due to reasons explained earlier, I hadn't progressed in a long time.</p>
