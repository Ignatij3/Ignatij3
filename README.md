To date, I have experience with following tools/languages:

| Technology      | Comment | Level | First experience |
|:----------------|:--------|:------|:-----------------|
| Golang          | This is my first and most favourite programming language. I love it because it has overly strict typing (which prevents a lot of misunderstanding) and C-like syntax, which, by itself, is quite intuitive (at least for me) and easy-to-read | Very advanced; I am familiar with a lot of nuances of the language, can write complex programs without assistance from linters/hints | January 2019 |
| C++             | I am currently planning to use C++ more, to actually feel the language and so I would have in my arsenal a popular and versatile programming language | I'd say I'm pretty mid in C++. I have been using it for quite some time, so I'm fairly familiar with it's syntax and some of the basic stepping stones, but since I hadn't used it in a while, it may take some time to refresh it in my mind | Autumn 2021 |
| C               | I am aware that programming in C is quite different form programming in C++, so I can't say that I am just as good in C as in C++. But there is possibility that I pick up this language since it's widely used in system programming and microcontroller programming which symphatizes me | Beginner - haven't used the language yet, but due to it's close resemblance to C++, I am familiar with it's syntax and structures | Not yet |
| VSCode          | VSCode is the only IDE I can work with, but personally it is not of concern to me, since it is remarkably flexible, has a nice look and is one of the most widely used IDEs, which means it is actively supported and improved | I can say I am an experienced user of VSCode. I have been using not only the editor, but also have spent some time configuring VSCode specific files which are placed in `.vscode` folder. Also, in the period of writing programs in C++ I have been using those "features" quite extensively which left a solid ground for remembering how to use it proficiently in case I abandon programming for some time | October 2020 |
| Python          |  |  |  |
| Git             |  |  |  |
| Github          |  |  |  |
| JSON            |  |  |  |
| Linux           |  |  |  |
| QT              |  |  |  |
| JS              |  |  |  |
| SQL             |  |  |  |
| Docker          |  |  |  |
| Neural Networks |  |  |  |
