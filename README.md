To date, I have experience with following tools/languages:

| Technology      | Comment | Skill description | First experience |
|:----------------|:--------|:------------------|:-----------------|
| Golang          | This is my first and most favourite programming language. I love it because it has overly strict typing (which prevents a lot of misunderstanding) and C-like syntax, which, by itself, is quite intuitive (at least for me) and easy-to-read | Very advanced; I am familiar with a lot of nuances of the language, can write complex programs without assistance from linters/hints | January 2019 |
| C++             | I am currently planning to use C++ more, to actually feel the language and so I would have in my arsenal a popular and versatile programming language | I'd say I'm pretty mid in C++. I have been using it for quite some time, so I'm fairly familiar with it's syntax and some of the basic stepping stones, but since I hadn't used it in a while, it may take some time to refresh it in my mind | Autumn 2021 |
| C               | I am aware that programming in C is quite different form programming in C++, so I can't say that I am just as good in C as in C++. But there is possibility that I pick up this language since it's widely used in system programming and microcontroller programming which symphatizes me | Beginner - haven't used the language yet, but due to it's close resemblance to C++, I am familiar with it's syntax and structures | Not yet |
| VSCode          | VSCode is the only IDE I can work with, but personally it is not of concern to me, since it is remarkably flexible, has a nice look and is one of the most widely used IDEs, which means it is actively supported and improved | I can say I am an experienced user of VSCode. I have been using not only the editor, but also have spent some time configuring VSCode specific files which are placed in `.vscode` folder. Also, in the period of writing programs in C++ I have been using those "features" quite extensively which left a solid ground for remembering how to use it proficiently in case I abandon programming for some time | October 2020 |
| Python          | Python is overall easy to learn and use language, but it has one major disatvantage which sometimes makes me consider using other languages, if I have a choice - complete lack of typing. It is obvious that lack of typing will bring up a lot of runtime errors that should be prevented, but those preventions lenghten code and decrease readability. Also, it sometimes is hardly readable due to it's lack of braces or any other reasonable definition of scope of visibility | Out of all languages, python is probably second best known to me. It's syntax is plain and simple, I am familiar with some of it's unique features/oddities | Around 2020/2021 |
| SQL             | I have quite little knowledge of databases, types of them and other related stuff, so in that sense I would require a lot of studying | I have a very basic knowledge of SQL, since I have spent around month learning/using it and then stopped. Nevertheless, I have at least a general idea about what it is | December 2019 |
| Git             | Out of all version control systems, Git is by far most popular which makes it reasonable to learn it early | I'm fairly familiar with git - I've been using it continiously since the named date and now I feel pretty comfortable with it. Though, I need a lot more experience using it to be able to use it freely | February 2021 |
| CMake           | Originally, I was introduced to CMake when dad recommended that I use it, instead of QMake (an alternative for Qt framework). Even though I used it mainly in context of compiling programs using Qt, I still had plenty experience with it. | When I used to programs that use Qt framework, I used CMake to make. Thanks to that - I'm quite familiar with it, although, not a very proficient user. Also, since I hadn't used it in a while, I will need some time to get a grip of it and to start using it again | December 2021 |
| Linux           |  |  |  |
| Qt              |  |  |  |
| HTML            |  |  |  |
| CSS             |  |  |  |
| Docker          |  |  |  |
| Neural Networks |  |  |  |
